# CSE587-Lab-2-Data-Cleaning-Munging
Cleaned, munged, repurposed and transformed data collected from Kaggle and Pew Research Center to interpret and visualize survey results.


GOALS:
Major goals of the lab2 are:

1. Convert data in various format into a form that is convenient for in-memory operations. Transform from external storage formats such as xml, sqllite into a common external format, comma separated value (.csv) convenient for exploratory data analysis using R. This allows for easy reading of data into the memory as data frames.

2. Extract (data munging) useful data from raw data collected by real survey instruments. You will use the actual survey document in interpreting the survey results.

3. Repurpose data from a popular domain (such as sports) for consumption by different genre of applications.

4. Transform data using operations such as grouping, categorization and binning to stage them for in-memory analysis. (R is optimized to work well with in-memory data.)

5. Document data cleaning steps using Markdown, a text-based HTML authoring format. This is an essential step in “reproducible research” and is offered within Jupyter platform.

6. Learn and understand the scientific data collection process, surveys, and nature of raw data and the need and motivation for cleaning and munging the data.
